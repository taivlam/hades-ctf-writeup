# Guidelines

One of the most telling signs of being a good cybersecurity analyst or software engineer is to document processes, techniques, and *hacks* employed to solve a problem. Now that you have successfully collaborated with Hera on tracking down the *insider* job at [Hades Enterprises](https://hadesenterprisesinc.com), it is your duty to document how you did itâ€”along with any intutions you based your guesses upon or code you might have used.

Below are some general guidelines that you need to follow as you craft your write-up:
- Before you start documenting anything at all, fill out the details in the main [README.md](README.md) file so that you can focus on the challenges hereon.
- Each challenge sent by Hera lives in its own directory with a corresponding `README.md` file. **Do not** change this strucutre.
- Feel free to add sample code (in a different file or within the write-up) and screenshots to your write-ups. Assets related to a challenge should be placed in the corresponding challenge directory itself.

For the technical aspects themselves, here are some tips:
- Explain the task itself, so that someone without in-depth knowledge of the challenge can also understand the idea
- Don't assume something is *obvious* just because you find it on your first attempt (because it might not be so obvious for others)â€”explain your analysis of the task wherever you can
- Include intermediate steps or calculations (say, for cryptography)

## Judging criteria

Write-ups will be judged for completeness, clarity and techniqueâ€”in that order.

## Prizes

The best write-up will be featured on the [null NEU blog](https://nullneu.org/blog) with appropriate credits.

## Setting up the write-up template

In case you are stuck figuring out how to get this repository set up for your team, the following instructions should assist you:
- This is a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository#about-template-repositories). So, anyone can create a copy of it and modify its contents. Once you are on the repository URL on GitHub, you can hit the *Use this template* button and choose *Create a new repository*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We require only one write-up per team, so only one person is required to create the repository and can add others as collaborators, if required.
- On the Create a new repository page, fill in the required details. Ensure that the repository is **Public**â€”otherwise we will not be able to judge the writeup.

> [!NOTE]
> Although you can name the repository as per your wishes, we recommend that you name it `<team-name>-hades-ctf-writeup` so that it is easily distinguishable.

- Create the repository and [add your team members](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#inviting-a-collaborator-to-a-personal-repository).

You're all set! ðŸŽ‰
